# Web UI (PWA) — the iPhone app

Phase 11. A self-contained mobile web page ([`ui/app.ts`](../ui/app.ts)) the backend serves at
**`/`** and **`/app`**. It's the primary iPhone UI — added to the Home Screen it runs full-screen
like a native app, with no App Store, signing, or Apple Developer account. See
[ADR-012](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#adr-012).

```
Safari → https://<your-app>.deno.dev/  →  Share → Add to Home Screen  →  full-screen app
                 │ same-origin fetch with INGEST_TOKEN (kept in localStorage)
                 ▼
        /checkin /quicklog /capture /events /ask /templates /products
```

## First run

Open the URL, tap the **⚙ gear**, paste your `INGEST_TOKEN`, **Save**. It's stored in a **cookie**
(plus `localStorage` as a fallback) on that device only (same trust level as putting it in a
Shortcut) — the cookie survives reloads and app relaunches even where an iOS standalone PWA clears
`localStorage`. A `401` from any action re-opens the token box.

## Screens (the daily slice)

- **Today** — a daily summary (caffeine, sleep, workout, mood/energy/focus averages, ingredient
  totals) from `GET /overview`; loads on open and refreshes after a check-in or quick-log. A date
  box loads any day (Phase 9).
- **Timeline** — a newest-first list of recent events from `GET /events?limit=50` (time, category,
  fields, source). **Refresh** reloads it (Phase 11d, R-VIEW-4).
- **Check in** — tap a 1–5 button for mood / energy / focus (any subset), add an optional **note**,
  **Log check-in** → `POST /checkin`.
- **Quick log** — buttons built from your `/templates` and `/products`; tap one to log it →
  `POST /quicklog`. **Options…** reveals a **servings** (scales a product's dose) and a **fields**
  override (`caffeine_mg=95, item=decaf`) applied to subsequent taps (Phase 11b).
- **Log manually** — pick a category, add field key/value rows, optionally set a **time** (blank =
  now, earlier = backdated), **Log event** → a single `POST /events` (`source: manual`). Numeric
  values are stored as numbers (Phase 11b).
- **Capture** — type, or tap the **mic on the iOS keyboard** and speak, then **Extract** →
  `POST /capture`. Each candidate is **editable** before saving — category, the extracted field
  values, and the **time** (a `datetime-local` picker; set it earlier to **backdate**, R-CAP-7) — or
  untick to skip it. **Save selected** → `POST /events`. (The confirmation step, R-CAP-9; an edited
  time is sent as `occurredAtConfidence: high`.)
- **Ask** — the five real-time questions → `POST /ask`. A **Window** control (24/48/72h) sets the
  look-back (`windowHours`); the answer shows with the **specific cited events** (time, category,
  fields) it reasoned from, not just a count (Phase 11d). Two questions take a word: "Why?" (a
  feeling) and "Should I?" (an action).
- **Manage** (Phase 11c) — set-up surfaces you reach rarely:
  - **New product** — name + category + ingredient rows → `POST /products`. **Scan label →
    ingredients** sends a photo to `POST /ingredient-scan` (Claude vision) and fills the rows for
    you to confirm/edit (the R-CAP-15 image path in the UI).
  - **New template** — name + category + a `key=value` fields string → `POST /templates`.
  - **Ingredient breakdown** — a product name + servings → `GET /products?name&servings`, showing
    the expanded per-ingredient amounts (R-PAT-5).

  Saving a product or template refreshes the **Quick log** buttons immediately.

## Add to Home Screen

Safari → **Share** → **Add to Home Screen**. The page declares `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, so it
launches chrome-free. Re-add after you change the deploy URL.

## Run locally

```sh
cd backend
DATABASE_URL=... INGEST_TOKEN=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... deno task start
# open http://localhost:8000/app
```

(`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is only needed for the Capture/Ask screens.)

## Not in this slice (future)

- Offline queue / widgets / Apple Watch — those need a native app (R-CAP-11), still future.

## Why not native SwiftUI

See [ADR-012](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#adr-012): a PWA is verifiable in our stack, ships now with
no toolchain, and matches "prove value first." Native stays an option later for the
offline/widget/Watch features a PWA can't do.
